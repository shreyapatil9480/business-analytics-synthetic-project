## Future Work

This project can be extended in several ways:

- **Additional Features:** Incorporate more variables such as project scope, stakeholder engagement, or risk assessments.
- **Advanced Models:** Experiment with gradient boosting, support vector machines, or neural networks.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use tools like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters.
- **Visualization Dashboards:** Build interactive dashboards (e.g., with Plotly or Dash) to share insights with stakeholders.
